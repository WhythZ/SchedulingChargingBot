## Homework
There are autonomous charging robots of particular quantity in the industrial park, each of them can move to any location to charge vehicles
- Each robot can charge a vehicle only if it's carrying a non-zero charged battery and its own charge is non-zero
- Limited number of robots and batteries need to be charged somewhere, which implies the number of available batteries should be considered when swapping battery
- The vehicals' arrival time, remaining battery level, location, departure time, required battery level when depart should be reasonably simulated
- The more charge a robot/battery/vehicle has, the slower the speed being charged

The goal is to arrange these robots in maximized utilization, multiple problem scales and scheduling strategies should be simulated
