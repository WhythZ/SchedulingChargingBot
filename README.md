## Requirements
There are particular quantity of autonomous charging robots in the industrial park, we need to arrange these robots in scheduling strategies to maximize their utilization, with multiple problem scales simulated
- Numerous vehicals will arrived randomly to be charged, which will depart once they acquire enough electricity
- Each of the robots needs to be charged somewhere, and can move to charge vehicle if they themselves have enough electricity

## Solution
This project uses SDL2 to visualize the scheduling process

There are three levels of problem scale
- Small 
- Medium 
- Large 

There are three strategies
- `StrategyA` 
- `StrategyB` 
- `StrategyC`
